// 1. Declare variables (arrays) for two decks of cards.
// 2. Create HTML elements (two <div>s) for the card decks:
  // 1. Deck 1 should display the back of a card with a shadow outline, indicating a larger stack.
  // 2. Deck 2 should display an empty card outline.
// 3. Create cached element references for each of the card decks.
// 4. Add an event listener for the "Flip" button.
// 5. Write an initialization function that assigns 52 cards" to deck 1, then invoke it.
// 6. Declare a render() function to display a card after it is flipped.
// 7. Stub up a handleClick() function for the event listener to call.
  // 1. Select a random card from deck 1.
  // 2. Remove the card from deck 1.
  // 3. Add the card to deck 2.
  // 4. Call the render() function and pass the card to it.
// 8. Within the render() function (situated above handleClick()):
  // 1. After the first card is picked, remove the outline on deck 2.
  // 2. Add the class name to display the card picked on deck 2.
  // 3. When half of the cards are flipped, move the shadow from deck 1 to deck 2.
  // 4. When the final card is picked, add an outline to deck 1.
